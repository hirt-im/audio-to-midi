# Audio to MIDI

Upload an audio file and have the notes transcribed and displayed. Control playback with a pause/play button and a slider to change its rate. Go to a specific part of the song by clicking on the horizontal note visualization. Save the transcription as a MIDI file for use in other software.

Works best on solo piano performances, but audio of other instruments can be transcribed as well, though the results will be less accurate. Trying to transcribe audio files containing multiple different instruments playing at the same time is not likely to lead to good results.

Utilizes the [Onsets and Frames](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/onsets-frames) model from [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/).
