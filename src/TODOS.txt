1. Fix seekTo when tempo is changed
2. Get audio file from youtube URL
3. Loading screen while its processing audio (robot emoji 'Processing...')
4. Fix OAF initializing multiple times 
5. Fix 'Error: Cannot start playback while `Tone.Transport` is in use' bug
6. Fix notes being misaligned to piano sometimes.. wtf


Feature ideas:
Looping, click and drag over vis2 to highlight section and loop over it



Add Description:
Say it works best for solo piano music, but you can try other instruments as well 




Playback speed rate bug:
The seekTo scales with the current PlayBackRate
if Playback rate is at 33%, seekTo will go to 33% of the time clicked
if it is 150%, it will jump ahead 150% of the value intended
